Documentation
-------------

- Explain about adding dependencies to setup.py so that anyone who clones the repo can quickly add the dependencies
 - requirements.txt : https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/managing-dependencies.html


Packaging
---------

Changed the structure of robinhoodbot so it's a package

A file that runs it needs to import it, or import parts of it, needs to use relative import syntax.
For example, instead of `import misc` it should be `from . import misc`
